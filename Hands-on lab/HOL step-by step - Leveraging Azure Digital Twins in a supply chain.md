# Leveraging Azure Digital Twins in a supply chain hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement an Azure IoT solution for a supply chain scenario. You will learn to interpret and author Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) that models physical and logical elements of an environment. You will use DTDL to represent an element's properties, telemetry, components, and relationships. Next, you will learn how to deploy the models into Azure Digital Twins and visualize them using Azure Digital Twins Explorer. You will learn how to leverage Azure Digital Twins by deploying an end-to-end IoT solution, including identifying anomalies and automating automatic failover of factory work using eventing.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement an end-to-end Azure IoT supply chain solution from telemetry ingestion to data insights, all while leveraging Azure Digital Twins.

## Overview

The Leveraging Azure Digital Twins in a supply chain hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using the supplied example based on Azure IoT infrastructure and related Azure services. The primary focus of this lab is to learn how to author and use Azure Digital Twins in an IoT solution. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

![The solution architecture diagram is shown as explained in the following paragraph.](media/solution_architecture.png "Solution architecture")

IoT sensors in Contoso Apparel's environment send telemetry into IoT Hub via a device connection string. An Azure Function is triggered on message ingestion to process the incoming telemetry and updates the appropriate digital twin in the Azure Digital Twins service. You can review this code in the `Hands-on lab/Resources/azurefunctionscode/IoTHubToTwins.cs` file. A route is established between the Azure Digital Twins Service and a second Azure Function so that the telemetry stream is made available to the SignalR service. Web applications are then able to subscribe to this SignalR hub to receive telemetry information. The source code for this second Azure Function is found in the `Hands-on lab/Resources/azurefunctionscode/SignalRFunctions.cs` file. A secondary route is established between the Azure Digital Twins service and an Event Hub intermediary to provide data into Time Series Insights via a third Azure Function. The source code for this third Azure Function is found in the `Hands-on lab/Resources/azurefunctionscode/ProcessDTUpdateToTSI.cs` file. A logic app is used to trigger digital twin updates for shipment progress.

## Requirements

1. Azure Subscription with the following permissions or capabilities:

   - Create and manage Azure resources

   - Manage user access to Azure resources (including granting and delegating permissions)

    > **Note**: Common roles that meet this requirement are Owner, Account admin, or the combination of User Access Administrator and Contributor.

2. [Azure CLI 2.3.1+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

3. PowerShell ([macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-6&preserve-view=true)) (Windows: PowerShell is built in)

4. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

5. [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

6. [C# Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)

7. [Node.js 10+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Authoring Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) models

Duration: 20 minutes

The Azure Digital Twins PaaS service's core offering is the ability to create knowledge graphs representing an entire environment based on digital models. An environment could be a store, a city, factory, farm, or even the whole planet. Contained within an environment, you will find people, places, and things. Each model defined is significant to a business and is entirely customizable. They can be as large as the world and as small as a tiny sensor. The environment, the components found within, and the relationships between them are represented digitally using a model expressed using Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL). Digital Twin Definition Language is based on JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data). Azure Digital Twins uses DTDL version 2. You can think of a model definition as being similar to a class in object-oriented programming. Later, you will use these model definitions to create digital twins instances representing specific entities in an environment.

In this exercise, you will be assisting Contoso Apparel in defining a model representing a storeroom. In Contoso's environment, we must track the temperature and humidity telemetry coming from the storeroom as well as the current stock level.

### Task 1: The components of a model

At the top level, a DTDL model defines an interface that encapsulates the rest of the model definition. A DTDL model interface may contain zero, one, or many of each of the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Property | Properties are data fields that represent the state of an entity (like the properties in many object-oriented programming languages). Properties have backing storage and can be read at any time. If the property is writeable, you can also store a value in the property.|
| Telemetry | Telemetry is a set of data messages that have short lifespans. If you don't set up listening for the event and actions to take when it happens, there is no trace of the event at a later time. You can't come back to it and read it later. Telemetry is typically a single measurement sent by a device. |
| Component |Components allow you to build your model interface as an assembly of other interfaces. Use a component to describe something that is an integral part of your solution but doesn't need a separate identity, and doesn't need to be created, deleted, or rearranged in the twin graph independently. |
| Relationship |  Relationships let you represent how a digital twin can be involved with other digital twins. Relationships can represent different semantic meanings, such as contains ("floor contains room"), cools ("hvac cools room"), isBilledTo ("compressor is billed to user"), etc. Relationships allow the solution to provide a graph of interrelated entities. |

It is essential to distinguish between properties and telemetry. With properties, it has a backing store so that you can read and query the data fields. Telemetry is the stream of data from an IoT device that contains things like temperature and humidity values. These values are not stored on the device itself. You are not able to query for the latest temperature value from a telemetry field. Instead, you'll need to have a data ingress function listen to the device's messages, and take actions as they arrive. Based on the business rules defined by the logic of the ingress function, you can then update a property based on the incoming telemetry (or property events) from the device using the Azure Digital Twins API.

Here is an example of a Planet model. Model files should be saved with the **.json** extension. This example demonstrates the proper syntax in defining the Planet interface, properties, telemetry, relationship, and component. Take note that when defining a component interface (Crater in this example), it should be defined in the same array as the interface that uses it (Planet).

```JavaScript
{
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Planet;1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
    "displayName": "Planet",
    "contents": [
    {
        "@type": "Property",
        "name": "name",
        "schema": "string"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Property",
        "name": "mass",
        "schema": "double"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Telemetry",
        "name": "Temperature",
        "schema": "double"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Relationship",
        "name": "satellites",
        "target": "dtmi:com:contoso:Moon;1"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Component",
        "name": "deepestCrater",
        "schema": "dtmi:com:contoso:Crater;1"
    }
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Crater;1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
},
{
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Moon;1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
}
  
```

> **Tip**: DTDL also supports model inheritance using the **extends** field.

Now we'll continue this exercise by defining a model for a storeroom using DTDL. Feel free to refer to the [DTDL specification](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) as a reference.

1. Let's begin by defining the interface for a storeroom. Open Visual Studio Code to the `Hands-on lab/Resources/models` folder, and create a new file named **storeroom.json**. Add the following text to this file:

    ```JavaScript
    {
        "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:storeroom;1",
        "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
        "@type": "Interface",
        "displayName": "StoreRoom"
    }
    ```

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | @id | required field, must take on the following standard format: **dtmi:DOMAIN:UNIQUE MODEL IDENTIFIER;MODEL VERSION NUMBER** |
    | @context | indicates that we are using DTDL version 2 |
    | @type | indicates the kind of information being described |
    | displayName | the friendly name of the model being described |

2. Now that we've defined our interface, we are able to define the contents of the model. Let's start with the properties of a storeroom. The current stock level is a property that Contoso Apparel needs to track and query. Continuing in the same file, add the following beneath the **displayName** field (Remember to add a comma after the displayName value!):

    ```JavaScript
    "contents": [
        {
            "@type": "Property",
            "name": "StockLevel",
            "schema": "integer",
            "writable": true
        }
    ]
    ```

3. Let's define the telemetry of a storeroom. In the case of Contoso Apparel's sensors, a storeroom sends a consistent stream of integer temperature and humidity values. Within the **contents** array, add the following telemetry definitions (Remember to add a comma after the StockLevel object definition.):

    ```JavaScript
    {
      "@type": "Telemetry",
      "name": "Humidity",
      "schema": "integer"
    },
    {
      "@type": ["Telemetry", "Temperature"],
      "name": "Temperature",
      "schema": "integer",
      "unit": "degreeCelsius"
    }
    ```

    You'll notice a slight difference in the definition of the Temperature telemetry type. In this case, the telemetry is defined with a [semantic type](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md#semantic-types). When using semantic types, the unit property must be an instance of the corresponding unit type, and the schema type must be a numeric type (double, float, integer, or long). The use of semantic types is optional. We could have defined the Humidity **@type** as **["Telemetry", "RelativeHumidity"]** (in the DTDL specification **RelativeHumidity** doesn't have a corresponding **unit** therefore need not be described in the model).

4. Review the final `storeroom.json` file and ensure it matches the following:

    ```JavaScript
    {
        "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:storeroom;1",
        "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
        "@type": "Interface",
        "displayName": "StoreRoom",
        "contents": [
            {
                "@type": "Property",
                "name": "StockLevel",
                "schema": "integer",
                "writable": true
            },
            {
                "@type": "Telemetry",
                "name": "Humidity",
                "schema": "integer"
            },
            {
                "@type": ["Telemetry", "Temperature"],
                "name": "Temperature",
                "schema": "integer",
                "unit": "degreeCelsius"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

5. Now we need to add StoreRoom as a relationship in the Factory model. Open the `Hands-on lab/Resources/models/factory.json` file, and add the following to the **contents** array:

    ```JavaScript
    {
        "@type": "Relationship",
        "name": "containsStoreRoom",
        "target": "dtmi:com:contoso:storeroom;1"
    }
    ```

### Task 2: Ontologies overview

In the previous task, we created a model definition of a storeroom manually. In this task, we'll investigate pre-existing model sets aligned to specific industries, also referred to as an ontology. Currently, there are two open-source DTDL ontologies that leverage industry standards in their model definitions. These are the [real estate industry smart building](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building), and the [smart city industry](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-smartcities). You can take advantage of these existing ontologies to form the basis of your model definitions. You can adopt them as-is and extend them as needed using model inheritance.

1. An ontology provides a common representation of places, infrastructure, and assets to enable interoperability and data sharing across multiple domains. In a new browser window or tab, visit the following URL: [https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building).

2. This ontology is representative of the **RealEstateCore** ontology for smart buildings. Take a moment and review the structure as well as the motivations behind this ontology by reading the README.md article found at this URL. This article also describes how to extend and contribute to this ontology.

3. Remaining on this website, navigate into the **Ontology/Space/Building/Building.json** file to view the definition of a building. Note that this model extends the **Space** definition located at **Ontology/Space/Space.json**.

4. You are also able to visualize and interact with the **RealEstateCore** ontology by opening the following URL in a new tab or window: [http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://w3id.org/rec/full/3.3/](http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://w3id.org/rec/full/3.3/).

    ![The RealEstateCore model visualization graph is displayed.](media/realestatecorevisualization.png "RealEstateCore model visualization")

5. When you have finished investigating the **RealEstateCore** ontology, you may close this tab. You may optionally investigate the [**Smart Cities** ontology](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-smartcities).

### Task 3: Validating the storeroom model

It is recommended that you validate your DTDL models offline prior to loading them into the Azure Digital Twins service. We will validate our model definitions using the [DTDL validator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/DTDL-Validator/tree/master/) to run validation on the models folder.

1. DTDL Validator code sample file is present in the Labfiles.

2. Using Visual Studio Code, open the DTDL validator folder located in the `C:\LabFiles\DTDL_Validator` path.

3. If you are prompted with notifications about missing assets and unresolved dependencies, select **Yes** and **Restore**.

    ![Two Visual Studio notifications are shown indicating the required assets to build and debug are missing from the Validator project as well as a notification indicating there are unresolved dependencies.](media/validatorprojectdependencieswarning.png "Visual Studio Code notifications")

4. Open a terminal window by selecting **View > Terminal** from the Visual Studio Code menu.

5. In the terminal, navigate to the application directory by executing the following command:

   ```Bash
   cd .\DTDLValidator-Sample\DTDLValidator\
   ```

6. Copy the full path to the **models** folder of this lab (`Hands-on lab/Resources/models`) to a text editor for use in the next step.

7. In the Visual Studio Code terminal window, execute the following command (replacing **MODEL_FOLDER_PATH** with the full path to your models folder copied in the previous step, keeping the quote characters intact):

    ```Bash
    dotnet run -d "MODEL_FOLDER_PATH"
    ```

8. You should get a message indicating that all files in the **models** folder are valid.

  ![A portion of the Visual Studio Code terminal window displays with a message indicating that all files have been validated and that the DTDL is valid.](media/validationtoolresults.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal Window Output")

## Exercise 2: Loading models into Azure Digital Twins

Duration: 25 minutes

In the previous exercise, we learned how to author and validate DTDL models. In this exercise, we will load these models into the Azure Digital Twins Azure service.

### Task 1: Configure Azure Digital Twins permissions

Specific permissions are required to have the ability to maintain models in the Azure Digital Twins service. In this exercise, you will add yourself as an **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** using role-based access control (RBAC).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the resource group you created for this lab.

2. Select the Azure Digital Twins service from the list named **digtwins<inject key="DeploymentID" />**.

    ![The resource group service listing displays with the Azure Digital Twins service selected.](media/resourcegrouplist_digitaltwins.png "Resource group service listing")

3. From the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)**, then expand the **+ Add** button in the toolbar and select **Add role assignment**.

    ![In the Azure Digital Twins service screen, Access control (IAM) is selected from the left menu. The +Add button is expanded with the Add role assignment option highlighted.](media/digtwins_iam_menu.png "Azure Digital Twins IAM")

4. In the **Add role assignment** blade, select the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role, and search for and select your Azure Active Directory account (search for your login email address). Select **Save**.

    ![The Add role assignment blade displays with an email in the Select field and a selected member chosen. The Save button is highlighted.](media/digtwins_addroleassignment.png "Add role assignment blade")

### Task 2: Loading models using the CLI

Azure Digital Twins has a command set for the Azure CLI that you can use to perform most management functions with the service. The commands relative to digital twins are part of the larger [Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension). You can review the digital twins command reference here: [az dt command reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/dt).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the resource group you created for this lab.

2. Select the **Azure Digital Twins** service from the list named **digtwins<inject key="DeploymentID" />**.

    ![The resource group service listing displays with the Azure Digital Twins service selected.](media/resourcegrouplist_digitaltwins.png "Resource group service listing")

3. On the **Overview** screen, record the values for **Resource group**, **Host name**, and the name of the Azure Digital Twins instance. You should store these values in a text editor for later use. Please note that your values will differ from the screenshot below.

   ![The Azure Digital Twins Overview screen displays with the resource name, Resource group, and Host name values highlighted.](media/digitaltwins_overview.png "Azure Digital Twins Overview")

4. Open a command prompt on your local machine.

5. Issue the following Azure CLI command to ensure that you are using the latest version of the Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI:

    ```Bash
    az extension add --upgrade -n azure-iot
    ```

6. Next, you will need to authenticate to Azure by executing the following command and following the instructions provided in the prompts:

    ```Bash
    az login
    ```

7. Change the current directory to the **models** folder of this lab (`Hands-on lab/Resources/models`) by issuing the following command (replacing **MODEL_FOLDER_PATH** with the full path to your models folder, retaining the quote characters):
  
    ```Bash
    cd "MODEL_FOLDER_PATH"
    ```

8. Upload the storeroom model using the CLI with the following command (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):

    ```Bash
    az dt model create -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME --models storeroom.json
    ```

    After a few seconds, you should see output similar to the following:

    ![Output from a console window is displayed showing a JSON definition of the storeroom model that was added to the Azure Digital Twins instance.](media/cli_addmodel_output.png "CLI console output")

9. Verify that your model was uploaded successfully by executing the following command that lists registered models with your Azure Digital Twins instance (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):
  
    ```Bash
    az dt model list -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME
    ```

10. Keep this CLI command window open for additional tasks later on in this lab.

### Task 3: Setup the Azure Digital Twins Explorer application

The Azure Digital Twins Explorer is a Node.js-based single-page web application that you will run on your computer. This application connects to an Azure Digital Twins instance and provides features to manage models and twins instances (along with their properties). Azure Digital Twins Explorer provides visualizations of the twins graph, editing twin instance properties and running queries across the twins graph.

1. When running locally, Azure Digital Twins Explorer will use Azure default credentials. In order to authenticate, you can run, for example, **az login** in any command prompt. When you later run Azure Digital Twins Explorer, it will pick up the credentials. Alternatively, you can sign into Visual Studio Code.

2. The sample code file is present in the `C:\LabFiles` path as 'digital-twins-explorer-main'.

3. From a command prompt, run `cd C:\LabFiles\digital-twins-explorer-main\digital-twins-explorer-main\client\src` folder, run `npm install`. This will retrieve all dependencies
    >**IMPORTANT!** Due to a dependency on the `npm-force-resolutions` package to mitigate an underlying security issue you will not be able to install under any path that contains a space.

5. Your browser should open and the app should appear.

6. With the Azure Digital Twins Explorer application running locally, the web application will display a modal window where you will enter the host name value for your Azure Digital Twins service instance. Be sure to pre-pend the host name value with **https://**, then select **Save**.

   ![A modal window is displayed prompting for the host name URL of the Azure Digital Twins service instance.](media/adtexplorer_hostnameentry.png "Azure Digital Twins Explorer Host Name Entry")

>**Note**: Prior to running the web application from the command prompt, remember to execute the **az login** command to ensure appropriate authentication.

### Task 4: Loading models using the Azure Digital Twins Explorer

The Azure Digital Twins Explorer provides an intuitive user interface to manage our Azure Digital Twins service instance. In this task, we will use this interface to upload the remainder of the models for our environment.

1. In the **MODELS** blade of the Azure Digital Twins Explorer, you should see the StoreRoom model that we uploaded via the CLI earlier.

    ![The Azure Digital Twins Explorer MODELS blade displays the storeroom model.](media/modelsblade_adt_storeroom.png "Azure Digital Twins Explorer MODELS blade")

2. In the **MODELS** blade, select the **Upload a Model** button.

    ![The Azure Digital Twins Explorer MODELS blade displays with the Upload a Model button highlighted.](media/adte_uploadamodelbutton.png "Azure Digital Twins Explorer Upload a Model")

3. Navigate to the lab **models** folder (`Hands-on lab/Resources/models`). The dialog allows uploading multiple files at once. Select all the files with the ***.json** extension in this folder, excluding **storeroom.json** since we've already uploaded this one via the CLI.

4. Verify that you have all 11 models loaded to the Azure Digital Twins instance.

    ![The Azure Digital Twins Explorer MODELS blade displays with 11 models listed.](media/adte_elevenmodels.png "Azure Digital Twins Explorer models listing")

5. Keep the Azure Digital Twins Explorer web application open for later tasks.

## Exercise 3: Creating digital twin instances to build an environment knowledge graph

Duration: 20 minutes

Now that we've modeled the entities in our environment, we are ready to create digital twin instances based on these models to represent the real-world artifacts. In this exercise, we will continue assisting Constoso Apparel with defining four of the storeroom instances that exist in their environment.

### Task 1: Create digital twin instances using the CLI

1. Leave the existing CLI Command Prompt window as it. Open a new CLI Command Prompt window and naviagte back to `client/src` folder.

2. The first storeroom that we will define has the identifier of **SR90636**. To create this digital twin instance, execute the following CLI command (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):
  
    ```Bash
    az dt twin create -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME --dtmi "dtmi:com:contoso:storeroom;1" --twin-id "SR90636"
    ```

3. The second storeroom that we will define has the identifier of **SR90637**. To create this digital twin instance, execute the following CLI command (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):
  
    ```Bash
    az dt twin create -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME --dtmi "dtmi:com:contoso:storeroom;1" --twin-id "SR90637"
    ```

4. Query for all defined digital twins by executing the following command (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):

    ```Bash
    az dt twin query -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME -q "select * from digitaltwins"
    ```

    ![A portion of a command window output is displayed showing a results array with two storeroom digital twins instances returned.](media/cli_queryresults_alltwins.png "Digital Twins query output")

5. Keep this CLI command window open for additional tasks later on in this lab.

### Task 2: Create a digital twin instance using the Azure Digital Twins Explorer

We will use the Azure Digital Twins Explorer web application to create two additional instances of a storeroom.

1. Return to the Azure Digital Twins Explorer web application.

2. In the **MODELS** blade, locate the **StoreRoom** model and select the **Create a Twin** button.

    ![A section of the MODELS blade displays with the Create a Twin button highlighted on the StoreRoom model item.](media/adte_createatwinbutton_storeroom.png "Create a Twin button")

3. We will now create a digital twin for the storeroom identified by **SR90638**. In the modal dialog that displays, enter `SR90638`, then select **Save**.

    ![A modal dialog displays with the value SR90638 entered in the New Twin Name text field.](media/adte_createtwin_SR90638.png "New Twin Name modal dialog")

4. Repeat the previous step and create a digital twin for the storeroom identified by **SR90639**.

5. You should see the two storeroom instances show on the **TWIN GRAPH** canvas in the web application.

   ![The TWIN GRAPH canvas displays with two circles representing both storerooms that were defined in this task.](media/adte_twingraph_twostorerooms.png "TWIN GRAPH")

6. You may be wondering where the other two storerooms are that we had defined in the CLI. To refresh the **TWIN GRAPH**, select the **Run Query** button from the **QUERY EXPLORER** section near the top of the screen. This operation queries the Azure Digital Twins service and returns all digital twins instances.

    ![The TWIN GRAPH canvas displays with four circles representing all the storeroom digital twins that are defined.](media/adte_twingraph_fourstorerooms.png "TWIN GRAPH")

7. In the **TWIN_GRAPH**, while holding the **Shift** key, select each of the four storeroom twins that we have created. Right-click to view the context menu, and select **Delete twin(s)**. We are doing this clean up so that they can be recreated in a different way in the next task.

8. Keep the Azure Digital Twins Explorer web application open for later tasks.

### Task 3: Importing digital twin instances using a spreadsheet

Creating digital twin instances one by one via CLI and in the Azure Digital Twins could be a lengthy task. Lucky for us, we can define and provide initialization details for bulk import via a spreadsheet.

1. In Azure Digital Twins Explorer, select the **Import Graph** button from the **TWIN GRAPH** canvas upper right toolbar.

    ![The TWIN GRAPH toolbar displays with the Import Graph button highlighted.](media/adte_importgraph_button.png "TWIN GRAPH toolbar")

2. In the open file dialog, navigate to the lab **models** folder (`Hands-on lab/Resources/models`). Select the `FullTwins.xlsx` file.

3. Select the **Save** icon at the upper right of the **IMPORT** canvas; this canvas shows a preview of the graph.

    ![The IMPORT graph preview displays with many additional nodes.](media/adte_graphimport_result.png "IMPORT graph")

4. Return to the **TWIN GRAPH**, and select the **Run Query** button from the **QUERY EXPLORER** to refresh the graph. Give this refresh a few moments to run.

5. Allow a few moments for the import to complete, then a dialog indicating a successful import will display.

    ![The Import Successful dialog displays indicating 152 twins have been imported along with 162 relationships](media/adte_graphimportsuccess_dialog.png "Azure Digital Twins Explorer Import Successful dialog")

6. Select the **TWIN GRAPH** tab and refresh it by selecting **Run Query**. Your graph should look substantially larger now.

   ![The TWINS GRAPH displays with many additional nodes.](media/adte_fulltwinsgraph.png "Updated TWINS GRAPH")

7. You can make the graph even more representative of the physical world by adding easy-to-identify iconography. To add icons representing each of our models, select the **Upload Model Images** button on the **MODELS** blade toolbar.

    ![The MODELS blade toolbar menu displays with the Upload Model Images button highlighted.](media/adte_modelstoolbar_importimages.png "Upload Model Images")

8. In the open file dialog, navigate to the **icons** folder found in the **models** folder of the lab(`Hands-on lab/Resources/models/icons`). Select all image files in this folder. Note the filename of the icons match the model identifiers and version of the models they represent.

9. Once uploaded, the **TWIN GRAPH** will refresh with the icons.

    ![A portion of the TWIN GRAPH is displayed with icons representing the models shown.](media/adte_filltwinsgraph_icons.png "TWIN GRAPH")

10. Keep the Azure Digital Twins Explorer web application open for later tasks.

## Exercise 4: Querying and visualizing the Azure Digital Twins graph

Duration: 5 minutes

The ability to query digital twins can provide insight into the current state of elements and operations in an environment. Azure Digital Twins provides a SQL-like [Azure Digital Twins query language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-query-language) to query and filter digital twins according to their properties, tag properties, models, relationships, and properties of relationships.

### Task 1: Run digital twin queries using the CLI

1. Return to your CLI command prompt window.

2. The first query we will perform is to retrieve all digital twins based on the storeroom model we created earlier in the lab. To initiate this query using the CLI, use the following command (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):

    ```Bash
    az dt twin query -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME -q "select * from digitaltwins where IS_OF_MODEL('dtmi:com:contoso:storeroom;1')"
    ```

3. This query then returns the details of all the storeroom digital twins defined by the environment.

    ![A portion of a console window output displays with data in JSON format representing a results array of query results.](media/cli_query_storerooms_result.png "Query output")

4. Keep this CLI command window open for additional tasks later on in this lab.

### Task 2: Run digital twin queries using Azure Digital Twins Explorer

1. In Azure Digital Twins Explorer, you have already used the **Query Explorer** to retrieve all digital twins instances to refresh the graph. This feature can also perform ad-hoc Digital Twins queries. Let's author a query to retrieve all digital twins that have a **Location** property. Enter the following query in the textbox, then select the **Run Query** button.

    ```SQL
    select * from digitaltwins where IS_DEFINED(Location)
    ```

2. The **TWIN GRAPH** will refresh and display only those digital twins instances where the **Location** property is defined. Select any node from the graph to view the properties.
  
    ![The Azure Digital Twins Explorer is shown with the above query in the textbox and the resulting graph displayed. A segment of the graph is highlighted with its details appearing in a blade to the right.](media/adte_query_locationresultsanddetail.png "Azure Digital Twins Explorer Query")

3. Keep the Azure Digital Twins Explorer web application open for later tasks.

## Exercise 5: Keeping Azure Digital Twin instances up-to-date

Duration: 60 minutes

It is critical that digital twins remain up-to-date with their real-world counterparts. In this exercise, we'll review some different approaches to updating digital twins.

### Task 1: Manually update the state of a digital twin using the CLI

1. In the CLI command window, execute the following command to update the **StockLevel** in storeroom **SR9036** to **42** (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name). Because this is our first time setting this value, we need to use the **add** operation.

    ```Bash
    az dt twin update -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME -g RESOURCEGROUP --twin-id "SR90636" --json-patch "{\"op\":\"add\",\"path\":\"/StockLevel\",\"value\":42}"
    ```

2. Use the CLI to view the updated value by executing the following command (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the lab resource group and ADT_INSTANCE_NAME with your Azure Digital Twins instance name):

    ```Bash
    az dt twin query -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n ADT_INSTANCE_NAME -q "select * from digitaltwins where $dtId='SR90636'"
    ```

3. Keep this CLI command window open for additional tasks in this lab.

### Task 2: Manually update the state of a digital twin using the Azure Digital Twins Explorer

1. In the Azure Digital Twins Explorer, enter the following query in the **QUERY EXPLORER**, and select **Run Query**. This query returns the same storeroom that we updated in the previous task.

    ```SQL
    select * from digitaltwins where $dtId='SR90636'
    ```

2. In the **TWIN GRAPH**, select the **SR90636** node. In the **PROPERTIES** pane, observe the **StockLevel** value is set to **42**.

    ![The PROPERTIES pane shows the storeroom properties with the StockLevel property highlighted with the value of 42.](media/adte_stocklevel_42.png "Storeroom properties")

3. Edit the **StockLevel** property by selecting the value. Type in the value **24** and select **Save**.

    ![The PROPERTIES pane shows the storeroom properties with the StockLevel property in edit mode with the value of 24 provided in the textbox. The Save icon is highlighted.](media/adte_stocklevel_24.png)

4. Once the operation completes, you are presented with the JSON patch information. Because the StockLevel property has already been set for this storeroom, it issued the **replace** operation.

    ![A dialog is shown with the JSON patch information indicating the StockLevel value has been replaced with 24.](media/adte_patch_information.png)

### Task 3: Using a logic application to trigger Azure Digital Twin updates for shipments

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you automate workflows across apps and services. By connecting Logic Apps to the Azure Digital Twins APIs, you can create automated flows to interact with your digital twins.

We will be using a Logic App to simulate shipment ETA information being updated from an ERP system. However, our Logic App runs on a timer that will randomly update the ETA for demonstration purposes.

1. We will first need grant the logic app Managed Service Identity permission to communicate with the DigitalTwins resource.

   - In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the lab resource group.

   - Select the Azure Digital Twins service resource **digtwins<inject key="DeploymentID" />**.

   - From the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.

   - Expand the **+ Add** button menu and select **Add role assignment**.

   - In the **Add role assignment** blade, select **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** as the role. In the search box, search for and select your logic app name **ShipmentArrivalTimeUpdateApp<inject key="DeploymentID" />**. Select **Save**.

2. Let's review the Logic application. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the lab resource group. Select the **Logic app** resource named **ShipmentArrivalTimeUpdateApp<inject key="DeploymentID" />**.

3. On the **Overview** screen of the Logic app, ensure the app is **Enabled**. If you see **Enable** in the toolbar menu, select it.

4. From the left menu, select **Logic app designer**.

5. Expand each activity of the flow. The **Recurrence** activity shows the Logic app is triggered every hour. The **HTTP** activity issues a twin query to the Azure Digital Twins instance to retrieve all shipment twins. This activity feeds the **Parse JSON** activity that deserializes the result of the query. The **For each** activity then iterates through each query result and adds a random number of minutes to the **EstimatedTimeOfArrival** value of the shipment. This update also calls the Azure Digital Twins instance via HTTP.

    ![The Logic app designer has the first two activities expanded described by the text above.](media/logicapp_activities_expanded.png "Logic app designer")

    ![The Logic app designer has the last two activities expanded described by the text above.](media/logicapp_activities_expanded2.png "Logic app designer")

6. From the left menu, select **Overview**, then select the **Enable** button from the top toolbar.

> **Note**: If desired, you can choose to execute the Logic app on-demand by selecting **Run Trigger** from the **Overview** screen of the service.

### Task 4: Simulating a real device and updating digital twins via telemetry ingestion

The best way to update device twin information is to base it on live data being ingested directly from the environment in real-time. In this task, we will setup an event grid subscription to feed an Azure Function that will then process the incoming messages and update digital twins accordingly.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the lab resource group and select the **IoT Hub** resource (**iothub<inject key="DeploymentID" />**).

2. From the left menu, select **Events**.

3. Select **+ Event Subscription** from the top toolbar.

4. In the **Create Event Subscription** form, enter the following information, then select the **Create** button:

    | Field | Value |
    |--------|--------|
    | Name | IoTHubToTwinsEvent |
    | Event Schema | Event Grid Schema |
    | System Topic Name | IoTHubToTwinsTopic |
    | Filter to Event Types | Ensure only **Device Telemetry** is selected. |
    | Endpoint Type | Azure Function |
    | Endpoint | Select the **Select an endpoint** link. Ensure the Function App **DTFunctions<inject key="DeploymentID" />** is selected, and choose the **IoTHubToTwins** function, then **Confirm Selection**. |

    ![The Select Azure Function form is displayed with the fields populated as described in the preceding table.](media/iothub_createeventsub_functionselection.png "Select Azure Function form")

5. We now need to ensure the Azure Function has permission to update digital twins instances. Open the CLI command window, and enter the following command to create a managed service identity for the Azure Functions app (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME and FUNCTION_APP_NAME with your values):

    ```Bash
    az functionapp identity assign -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n FUNCTION_APP_NAME
    ```

6. Record the **principalId** value from the output of the previous step.

   ![Console output displays with the principalId value highlighted.](media/azurefunctions_msi_consoleoutput.png "Console output of MSI creation")

7. Now, we'll assign the Azure Functions managed service identity (MSI) permissions to the Azure Digital Twins service by assigning it the **Digital Twins Data Owner** role. In the CLI command window, and issue the following command (replacing RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, DIGITAL_TWINS_INSTANCE_NAME and PRINCIPAL_ID with your values):

    ```Bash
    az dt role-assignment create -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --dt-name DIGITAL_TWINS_INSTANCE_NAME --assignee "PRINCIPAL_ID" --role "Azure Digital Twins Data Owner"
    ```

8. We will now configure our Azure Digital Twins Explorer application to register for real-time updates using SignalR. We will need to create a route from the Azure Digital Twins service to a broker Azure Function to update SignalR with the incoming data.

   - In the CLI command window, execute the following command to establish a route from the Azure Digital Twins service (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, DIGITAL_TWINS_INSTANCE_NAME with your values):

        ```Bash
        az dt route create -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --dt-name DIGITAL_TWINS_INSTANCE_NAME --endpoint-name DTEndpoint --route-name DTRoute
        ```

   - In the Azure portal, open the lab resource group and select the **EventGrid<inject key="DeploymentID" />** Event Grid Topic resource.

   - Select **+ Event Subscription** from the top toolbar menu.

   - In the **Create Event Subscription** form, fill it out as follows, then select **Create**:

        | Field | Value |
        |-------|-------|
        | Name | DTToSignalR |
        | Event Schema | Event Grid Schema |
        | Endpoint Type | Azure Function |
        | Endpoint | Select the **Select an endpoint** link, then choose the **DTFunctions<inject key="DeploymentID" />** Function app. For the Function, select the **broadcast** function. Select **Confirm Selection**. |

    >**Note**: Because we are running the Azure Digital Twins Explorer locally, we are not able to leverage the SignalR hub. Alternatively, you could follow guidance on deploying the Azure Digital Twins Explorer as a cloud service and configure it to receive updates from SignalR. You can find this guidance on the [Azure Digital Twins Explorer repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-explorer#advanced).

9. To enable device simulation, we will need to retrieve the IoT Hub connection string.

   - In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the lab resource group and select the **IoT Hub** resource ({PREFIX}iothub).

   - From the left menu, select **Shared access policies**.

   - Select the **iothubowner** policy from the left menu.

   - In the **iothubowner** blade, select the **Copy** button next to the **Primary connection string** text box. Record this value for a future task.

        ![The iothubowner blade displays with the Copy button highlighted next to the primary connection string value.](media/iothubowner_primaryconnectionstring.png "iothubowner policy blade")

10. In Visual Studio Code, open the **devicesimulation** folder (`Hands-on lab/Resources/devicesimulation`).

11. Open the **appSettings.json** file, and paste the IoT Hub connection string that you have previously recorded. Save the file.

12. Select **View** from the top menu, and select **Terminal** to open a terminal window.

13. Execute the following command in the terminal window:

    ```Bash
    dotnet run
    ```

14. This will start the devices simulator program. When prompted, enter the command: **start** and press the **Enter** key. This simulation will register and initialize many IoT devices, then will begin sending updates. By default, this simulation is set to run for 10 minutes.

15. Identify a device in the output that you would like to track, and use the Azure Digital Twins Explorer application to query for and view the properties.

## Exercise 6: Visualizing incoming data with Azure Time Series Insights

Duration: 20 minutes

The capability of querying digital twins either via CLI or via the Azure Digital Twins Explorer application is very useful to discover the point-in-time state of the environment. Further reporting is possible through feeding incoming digital twins updates to Time Series Insights.

### Task 1: Configure security of Time Series Insights

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the lab resource group.

2. In the list of resources, select the **tsi<inject key="DeploymentID" />** Time Series Insights environment resource.

3. From the left menu, select **Data Access Policies** from beneath the **Settings** section.

4. Select **+ Add** from the top toolbar menu.

5. In the **Select User Role** form, select the **Select user** link.

6. In the **Select User** blade, search for your account, and choose **Select**.

7. Check both the **Reader** and **Contributor** checkboxes, then select **Save**.

    ![The Select User Role form is shown with a user selected and both the Reader and Contributor roles checked.](media/tsi_selectuserrole.png "Select User Role")

### Task 2: Create a route from Azure Digital Twins for Time Series Insights

1. In the CLI Command window, create a new route on your Azure Digital Twins instance so that all digital twins updates will be routed through an endpoint. Execute the following command to establish this route (replace RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME and DIGITAL_TWINS_INSTANCE_NAME with your own values):

    ```Bash
    az dt route create -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -n DIGITAL_TWINS_INSTANCE_NAME --endpoint-name EventHubEndpoint --route-name EventHubRoute --filter "type = 'Microsoft.DigitalTwins.Twin.Update'"
    ```

2. Establishing this route will provide data into an event hub located in the **eventhubnamespaces<inject key="DeploymentID" />** resource of the lab resource group. This event hub (**tsieventhub**) exposes a **tsi-preview** consumer group which is used as the Event Source of the Time Series Insights environment.

### Task 3: View incoming telemetry using Time Series Insights

1. Ensure the device simulator is still running, if it has been more than 10 minutes, it may have completed. Simply restart the device simulator using the same steps as before.

2. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the lab resource group.

3. In the list of resources, select the **tsi<inject key="DeploymentID" />** Time Series Insights environment resource.

4. Select **Event Sources** from the left menu, and observe the **HubInput** details that are pointing to the **tsieventhub** using the **tsi-preview** consumer group.

5. Select **Overview**, then select **Go to TSI Explorer** button from the top toolbar.

6. From the left menu of the designer, select a twin and choose to add all items in the list. This will add the relative graphs to the canvas.

    ![A twin is selected from the left list, all measures are selected and the Add button is highlighted.](media/tsi_addvisualizations.png "Add TSI visualization")

    ![The resulting graph displays in the TSI canvas.](media/resulting_tsigraph.png "TSI visualization")

7. Spend additional time adding additional visualizations to the Time Series Insights canvas.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 5 minutes

### Task 1: Delete resource group

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), delete the resource group you created for this lab.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
